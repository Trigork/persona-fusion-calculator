Functionality:
  Add possibility of multiple fusion results based on having or not DLCs/Items (List all possibilities)
  Fix fusions of Zeus x Warrior Zeus (Can't happen)
  Fusion routes shouldn't be case sensitive:
    a) Lowercase Database and present capitalized texts with filters
    b) Index by capitalizing correctly
  HTML5Mode for routing?

Styling:
  Implement general navigation and layout
  Add some rad animations (single page ahoy!)
  Change level drop-downs to horizontal sliders

Build and Automation:
  Make gulp script to create the distributable version:
    - Compile Sass
    - Minify everything
    - Change library routes to their minified counterparts in index.html
      !! Beware of the BASE tag if using HTML5Mode !!
    - Pack everything in a persona-fusion-calculator zip file for github release
